# shader-library
This is a personal library of custom shaders.


I am starting this repository from almost 0 shader knowledge, and this will serve as a personal blog to document my learning as well as a library of finished shader projects. (Hopefully!)


# Breakdown
The repository is broken down into the following sections:
- shaders - folder of finished project folders
- in-development - folder of unfinished project folders
- learning - random files used for testing specific things for learning purposes; just a place for me to transfer files between computers and document my learning progress *can safely be ignored
