# Overview
These files are simple testing/learning files showcasing a single GLSL concept. This serves as a timeline of my progress. Inspect
the commit details for any given file for a longer form description of the targeted topic and learning achievements.

# Credit
All of the shader files found here are my versions of the lessons from [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/00/)
by [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](https://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/). It is a fantastic resource for learning GLSL shaders and I
would highly reccommend checking it out as well as his other work contained on his website.
